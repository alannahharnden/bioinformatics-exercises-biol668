Before starting the script, put these files on your Desktop:
1) RTestData.txt
2) primer.csv
3) r_bash.sh r.py test.r

#READING DATAFILES & SETTING VARIABLES

First start R, then run these commands

> list.files('~') #are all the files present?
> d1=read.table('RTestData.txt', header=TRUE)
> d1
> fuso
> d1$fuso
> attach(d1)
> fuso

Plot d1$strep using the hist function
Run qqnorm with d1$strep - is it linear?
Do a log transform of d1$strep
> lstrep=d1$strep
Run qqnorm of lstrep
Plot lstrep with the hist function

Run a t.test with d$strep and d$fuso
Run a t.test with lstrep and d$fuso

(How did the test statistic and p-value change? Why did the p-value change?)


> d2=read.csv('primer.csv')  #Put in the same directory as your R script
> attach(d2)
Show the data frame 
Show the V1 variable

#SORTING SUBSETTING DATA

> newdata=d1[order(time),]
